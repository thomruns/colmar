This is the capstone project for Codecademy. It is the landing page for the fictional Colmar Academy.

The file structure for the site consists of an index.html page in the root site directory, and a subfolder titled resources, in which are three subdirectories: css, images, and videos.

Updated 5.16.17: A second page was added to test out links on the index page.

Update 5.18.17: CSS validated and (2)errors found/corrected.

Update 5.21.17: Color palette chosen. A monochromatic blue palette was selected as blue was a predominant color of all client-provided assets, and, as it is a cool color, fits appropriately with the tagline "Where the cool kids go" shown on the link page. This is a completely made-up tagline but one that the client seemed to like.
